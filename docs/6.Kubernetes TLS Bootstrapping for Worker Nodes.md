## ðŸ§  Why TLS Bootstrapping?

In Kubernetes, each **kubelet** (the agent running on worker nodes) must authenticate to the control plane and communicate over a secure TLS connection. When adding new worker nodes to the cluster, they must request a client certificate signed by the Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA).

**TLS bootstrapping** automates this secure onboarding process by allowing kubelets to:

- Authenticate using a temporary **bootstrap token**
- Request a signed certificate using the **Certificate Signing Request (CSR) API**
- Automatically get their CSR **approved**
- **Renew** their certificate before it expires â€” all without manual admin involvement

This setup is essential for **scaling**, **automation**, and **security** in production Kubernetes clusters.
