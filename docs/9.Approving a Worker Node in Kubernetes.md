In Kubernetes, when adding a new worker node to the cluster, the node must go through a certificate signing request (CSR) process for the kubelet to be authenticated. If the node is in a `NotReady` state, this usually means that the CSR has not been approved yet.

## Steps to Approve a Worker Node

### Step 1: Check the CSR Status

To check if there are any pending certificate signing requests (CSR), use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csr
```
This will display a list of all CSRs in the cluster. For example:

### Step 2: Approve the CSR
To approve the CSR for a worker node, use the following command, replacing csr-pmrvj with the actual name of the CSR:
```bash
kubectl certificate approve csr-pmrvj
kubetl get nodes
```
